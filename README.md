# php-redirect-utm
This is a very initial release!

Redirect/forward based on domain, path, parameters and UTM parameters.
Redirects can be set very individual as well as UTM parameters wich can be defined.
Short codes for UTM parameters can be defined and will be translated and forwarded.
Google Analytics Measurement Protocol can be used to store original UTM parameters.

## Audience
This is a very initial release. A lot of the configuration possibilities is just coded at the moment and less commented.
At this stage you need advanced skills in PHP programming to set your redirects mostly using if/else requests. The config files are commented and examples are shown.

## Prerequisites
PHP coding skills are necessary!

## Installation
Drop the "http" files to your webspace, wherever you need it. If you want to redirect multiple domains, you need configure your web server to point at this folder. The scripts will do the redirect based on the config you define.
All files beginning with "config" will have examples in it and show how to fill the needed variables.
